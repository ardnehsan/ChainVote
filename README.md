# VoteChain
VoteChain is a web app that uses blockchain technology to try and emulate what a real online election could be like. VoteChain can be used for businesses or even scale up to U.S. elections! Users are even able to vote from anywhere including their phones. VoteChain uses blockchains to ensure that votes are immutable and verified. As an added security measure, only users from a premade data set will be able to register so that only the people we want to vote will be able to do so.

## How Blockchains Work
A Blockchain contains many blocks. Each block contains information and in VoteChain's case, they each contain one vote. Every block has a unique hash that is created upon the creation of the block. The blocks are created in order so that a newer block will reference a previous block's hash. This causes the blockchain to be immutable meaning that the votes in VoteChain can never be changed or removed. For an online voting system to work, blockchains are integral to insure secure and verified votes. There are currently very few verified online voting systems that exist today.
